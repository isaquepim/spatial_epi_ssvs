# Variable Selection for spatial epidemiology - TCC
My goal is to develop a stochastic search variable selection strategy (SSVS) coupled to a Besag-York-Moli√© (BYM) spatial model. In particular, adapt to NIMBLE an efficient marginalized implementation in the Stan language. The project will analyze a rich set of epidemiological data from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa between 2013 and 2016.
