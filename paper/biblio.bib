 abstract = {A simple method for subset selection of independent variables in regression models is proposed. We expand the usual regression equation to an equation that incorporates all possible subsets of predictors by adding indicator variables as parameters. The vector of indicator variables dictates which predictors to include. Several choices of priors can be employed for the unknown regression coefficients and the unknown indicator parameters. The posterior distribution of the indicator vector is approximated by means of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We select subsets with high posterior probabilities. In addition to linear models, we consider generalized linear models.},

@ARTICLE{Harrison2014-up,
  title    = "Using observation-level random effects to model overdispersion in
              count data in ecology and evolution",
  author   = "Harrison, Xavier A",
  abstract = "Overdispersion is common in models of count data in ecology and
              evolutionary biology, and can occur due to missing covariates,
              non-independent (aggregated) data, or an excess frequency of
              zeroes (zero-inflation). Accounting for overdispersion in such
              models is vital, as failing to do so can lead to biased parameter
              estimates, and false conclusions regarding hypotheses of
              interest. Observation-level random effects (OLRE), where each
              data point receives a unique level of a random effect that models
              the extra-Poisson variation present in the data, are commonly
              employed to cope with overdispersion in count data. However
              studies investigating the efficacy of observation-level random
              effects as a means to deal with overdispersion are scarce. Here I
              use simulations to show that in cases where overdispersion is
              caused by random extra-Poisson noise, or aggregation in the count
              data, observation-level random effects yield more accurate
              parameter estimates compared to when overdispersion is simply
              ignored. Conversely, OLRE fail to reduce bias in zero-inflated
              data, and in some cases increase bias at high levels of
              overdispersion. There was a positive relationship between the
              magnitude of overdispersion and the degree of bias in parameter
              estimates. Critically, the simulations reveal that failing to
              account for overdispersion in mixed models can erroneously
              inflate measures of explained variance (r (2)), which may lead to
              researchers overestimating the predictive power of variables of
              interest. This work suggests use of observation-level random
              effects provides a simple and robust means to account for
              overdispersion in count data, but also that their ability to
              minimise bias is not uniform across all types of overdispersion
              and must be applied judiciously.",
